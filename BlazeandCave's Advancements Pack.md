BlazeandCave's advancements pack is one of the first advancement datapacks ever created and is also one of the largest and most feature-packed. It adds over 800 new advancements to your world so you have some extra challenges to do in your survival world.

The current version requires 1.16.2, 1.16.3, 1.16.4 or 1.16.5.

The current alpha build requires 21w07a. It may or may not work for future versions.


Notable features:
- Over 800 new advancements!
BlazeandCave's Advancements Pack adds over 800 new advancements to your world, bringing the total up to 878, which brings numerous new challenges to your survival world or a competitiveness to servers. Some new advancements are inspired by various existing pre-1.12 achievements as well as achievements that are exclusive to the Bedrock or Console editions of Minecraft. Many are purely original ideas of my own or of other people (see extra credits section). You may find a list of advancements here.


- 16 Advancement Tabs in total!

All five of the tabs in vanilla advancements have had many more advancements added to expand upon what was already there, and many new advancement tabs have been added for more specific categories.
BlazeandCave's Advancements - Contains a few basic advancements that start you off in a brave new world, as well as all the milestone advancements, which keep track of how many advancements have been obtained in each of the other tabs.
Mining - The mining-related advancements from the vanilla tab "Minecraft" have been taken and expanded upon greatly into the "Mining" tab with more advancements relating to each of the different ores and what you can do with them.
Building - A brand new tab that is all about crafting and building using various blocks.
Farming - The vanilla "Husbandry" tab has been split up into the Farming and Animals tabs. The Farming tab focuses on crops and various plants in Minecraft.
Animals - The Animals tab is largely about breeding, slaughtering and taming animals in Minecraft, and fishing.
Monsters - A brand new tab that takes some of the monster-related advancements from the vanilla "Adventure" tab and expands upon them greatly with unique advancements and challenges for nearly every monster in Minecraft.
Weaponry - A brand new tab that is about weapons, both conventional and unconventional.
Biomes - A brand new tab that contains advancements relating to various biomes, including the ocean.
Adventure - The vanilla "Adventure" tab has been expanded upon greatly with more advancements relating to exploration, villages, trading, raids, and various structures like the ocean monument and woodland mansion.
Redstone - A brand new tab that is all about crafting and using various redstone components.
Enchanting - A brand new tab that is all about enchanting items.

The End - The vanilla "The End" tab has been expanded upon greatly with more advancements relating to the dark, barren dimension and the monsters and structures within.
Super Challenges - Contains the most difficult advancements in the datapack. Many of these test the limits of what can be done in Minecraft.

- Advancement scoreboard.

There is a built-in scoreboard that will count how many advancements you have obtained so far in your world. Great for seeing your progress or for competing with your friends!


- Item Rewards and Trophies given via functions.

Item rewards give you a little bonus for completing many of the advancements, while trophies are special decorative items that are awarded for completing many challenge advancements. These features can both be separately toggled on and off (see below).


- Full translation support.

All advancements are fully translatable using the BACAP Language Resource Pack - currently Spanish, Russian, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Ukrainian, Pirate Speak and LOLCAT languages are supported. Download and details on how to help translate are below.


Installation:
1) Unzip the compressed folder that you downloaded. Inside should be this read me document and a folder labeled "bac_advancements"

2) This step depends on if you wish to install the datapack in a brand new world or in an existing world.

- For a new world: You can click the "Data Packs" option when creating a new world. Upon doing this, either open the world folder and copy in the "bac_advancements" folder, or click and drag the "bac_advancements" folder directly into the menu. Once it is imported, mouse over the icon for BlazeandCave's advancements pack so an arrow appears, then click the arrow to load the datapack.

- For an existing world: Click on the world in the singleplayer menu, then click "Edit", then "Open World Folder". Then go into the "datapacks" folder, and copy and paste the the folder labeled "bac_advancements" from the download here.

3) Go into the world. A message should pop up saying you are using BlazeandCave's advancements pack. If not, check your advancements menu. You should see the custom tab named "BlazeandCave's Advancements"If you forgot to load the datapack when creating from a new world, type the command: /datapack enable "file/bac_advancements"


Configuration:
The advancements pack can be easily configured using the config menu, which can be displayed by running the following command:
/function blazeandcave:config

Using the config menu you can:
- Disable and enable item rewards, trophies, and the welcome message by simply clicking their checkboxes.
- Display the advancements scoreboard on the tab list and/or sidebar. You can also clear it from there.
- Update the advancements scoreboard for all players online.
- Grant trophies for all players based on what advancements they have achieved so far.

Warning: The config menu will not open if you do not have operator permissions. This includes if you are playing on Hardcore mode. To gain operator permissions in singleplayer, click "Open to LAN" then click "Allow Cheats" so that it is set to ON.

Using the Language Resource Pack:
BlazeandCave's Advancements Pack has support for translation into other languages through use of the BACAP Language Resource Pack, which can be downloaded here.
The Language Pack is a resource pack that, instead of changing textures, adds more to language files to be used by the advancements pack.
It is installed just like any other resource pack.
When using it, you may choose any language that the Advancement Pack supports and it will change the names and descriptions of all of the advancements into that language.
The following languages are supported, and I hope to add more in the future:

- French (By Personnedu59, Zangdarss and Chucky2401) (Fully Translated)
- Russian (By SoSeDiK, vlad8599 and KorS1z) (Fully Translated)
- Portuguese (By Ralph10) (Fully Translated)
- Chinese (Traditional) (By TorchGod) (Fully translated)
- Ukrainian (By PurpleBear) (Fully Translated)
- Spanish (By EsFredderick and Parritoso) (Only translated up to 1.10)
- Chinese (Simplified) (By Remilias_Scarlet, EddieT and SleepyAsh) (Only translated up to 1.10)
- Korean (By 원숭이) (Only translated up to 1.9)
- German (By PuddingPapst) (Only translated up to 1.8)
- Japanese (By Atmosphere Tile) (Only translated up to 1.6)

- Pirate Speak (PIRATE) (By Cavinator1) (Fully Translated)
- LOLCAT (Kingdom of Cats) (By Cavinator1) (Fully Translated)

If you want to help me translate, you can get the base language file, which is an empty language file, which comes with the latest version of the BACAP Language Resource Pack, translate it, then send it back to me in a private message. You will be credited.

If you are running a server, please note in the description that it supports translation using the BACAP Language Pack, and provide a link to the Planet Minecraft page.


Updating to newer versions:
The Advancements Pack will be updated for later Minecraft versions and snapshots to add more advancements or fix bugs. Here is how to safely update to newer versions:

1) Make a backup of your world for safety if you screw anything up
2) Leave your world for more safety and don't go in during the process
3) Delete the old datapacks COMPLETELY from your world
4) Copy and paste in the new updated datapacks
5) Go into your world
6) If you screwed up, go to your backup, make a backup of your backup, then repeat steps 2-6 on the backup.


Caves and Cliffs Alpha Build:
The current Alpha Build for Minecraft 1.17's snapshots works in snapshots 21w07a.

It currently adds 62 new advancements (for a total of 940), overhauls the structure and design of some advancement tabs, and adds some custom-coloured description text for goals, milestones and super challenges.

Do be warned that because this is a very early Alpha Build, new advancements are subject to change in terms of where they are located or how they are designed or named. In addition, some (namely, advancements relating to Axolotls, Glow Squids, and the Lush Cave blocks) are currently unobtainable in vanilla survival, but using Creative you can get a glimpse of how they have been put together.

In addition, if you upgrade a world that used an older version of this datapack to this alpha build, a large number of advancements' progress will reset. This is intentional as part of some internal overhauls.
